# Heptaconn: Separating Admission and Execution

Most systems conflate admission and execution.

They accept work before they know whether they can complete it.
They queue silently.
They hide latency inside compute.

Heptaconn separates:

1. Admission
2. Execution
3. Accounting

This is not about AI.
It is about boundaries.

More soon.
